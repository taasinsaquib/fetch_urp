	<h2>Abstract</h2>

	<p>
	
	The ever-expanding field of artificial life has presented many realistic animations of animals. Here, we present Fetch: a dog simulation model that aims to have a dog play fetch with a bone. Through neural network based reinforcement learning, the dog is able to make the correct action in regards to retrieving the bone. Ml-Agents was also utilized in order to draw from a wide variety of reinforcement algorithms. With regards to vision, we used 2 ONVs, one for each of the dog. Results stuff.
