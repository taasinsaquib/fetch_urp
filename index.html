	<h2>Abstract</h2>

	<p>
	
	We present Fetch - a simulation of a dog playing fetch with a bone. We set out to create locomotion and vision subsystems that, through neural network based learning, would allow the dog to track the bone, which will be thrown, and move towards it. Ml-Agents was utilized in order to draw from a wide variety of reinforcement learning algorithms to train the locomotion network. With regards to vision, we trained fully connected and convolutional neural networks that take unstructured pixel data as input. Time constraints prevented us from combining the subsystems, but we successfully trained the dog to move forward (with an awkward gait) and have a retina neural network that can identify where the bone is.
